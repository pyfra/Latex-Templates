# Latex--Templates
A collection of Latex files used mostly as a reference to write reports/research papers. 

The reasons for this repository are:
1) a quick reference for codes I have used in the past
2) an inspiration to decide what format to use

I will try to update it everytime I stumble on something that it seems itneresting.
